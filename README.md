# IMPORTANT!
This version of the app is currently not working because the scripts to the p5, p5.sound and ml5 are outdated. I wanted to refresh the code a bit as well, so I decided to re-do the app using React. You can already see the first deployment here: https://synesthesia-react.vercel.app/. And also the repository where I am uploading the code: https://github.com/neusgp/synesthesia-react. 

# SYNESTHESIA (2022)

## About
This is the last project that I did at the Bootcamp. We only had one week to materialize an idea, and after three months of intense learning I wanted to do something a bit fresh and pleasing to my imagination. Finally, I came up with a quite abstract project where sound, colors and interaction would play the main part. SINESTHESIA is a small playground where you can produce a sound, choose a color to represent it and paint with it in a canvas.

## Tools
The language used to build this app is Javascript. Here are the libraries I used to build the main features:
- :window: Canvas display, :microphone: microphone control and :art: color pickers: https://p5js.org/
- :sound: Pitch detection: https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/pitch-detection
